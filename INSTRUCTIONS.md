# Getting Started
## Clone or Download from Github

### Requirements
- Node.js / NVM
- Any code editor of your choice

### Setting Up

First, clone the repo from the command line, or download the package at the top right:

`git clone https://github.com/cephil/react-calendar-part-1.git`

Change into the cloned directory with `cd react-calendar-part-1` and run `npm install`.

### Running the Server

The application is running Webpack with Hot-Reload. In order to run the server, `npm start` is all you need to start the dev build process. All the required dependencies exist, and you should be able to make changes as you see fit!

Any time you make a change, or save, the Hot-Reload package will automatically inject your changes into the browser, so you don't need to refresh! Feel free to use as you'd like, or PR for any code cleanup/syntax issues.

### Part 2: Refactoring

See you in part 2, when we refactor this with better practices! I will set up another repository, and perhaps screen record how I go about refactoring a project like this - to make it easier to understand.

Thanks for checking this out!
